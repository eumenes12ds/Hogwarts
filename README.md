# Hogwarts Japanese runtime assets

Card-owned dependencies for `ホグワーツ：運命の岐路`. Release: `v2026.10.17.1`.

This repository contains runtime code, its maintained source, dependency modules, and licenses. It contains no character narrative, preset payload, cover image, account data, connection settings or credentials.

## Origins and modifications

- MagVarUpdate: `MagicalAstrogy/MagVarUpdate` commit `54be11b09f21b1c4266e2d54b6f1ba9a3598db05`, the exact source version of the Chinese card's original runtime. The original bundle SHA-256 is `cd02eb51e63af4f3ee9edc57c2d9f46f27063bf535c2fec45f66945af9429d60`. Japanese UI, help, settings keys/enums, isolated `mvu_jp_settings` persistence, and seven action names are localized. Upstream request behavior, including incremental correction, is retained. See `LICENSE-MagVarUpdate`.
- `mvu_zod`: `StageDog/tavern_resource` commit `12983fa53d4da19dc1f2a5e6b8c37a0eb12f2aa5`. Its original bundle SHA-256 is `e540ab99589ad83de1495056a84693bda00af92f8848926bcb9a53b9263a0302`. Changes are Japanese diagnostics and relative dependency imports. **This component retains the Aladdin Free Public License**, reproduced in `LICENSE-tavern-resource`; it is not relicensed as MIT. Corresponding source is in `source/tavern_resource`.
- 87 browser ESM dependency modules are mirrored under `vendor/esm`, with exact origins and hashes in `vendor/manifest.json`. Original versions are retained; import specifiers are rewritten to local relative files. Package notices are in `vendor/licenses` and indexed in `vendor/licenses.json`.

## Build

Install the dependencies recorded by `source/MagVarUpdate/package.json` and its lockfile. Run its production webpack build, then run `node postprocess.cjs` at this repository root. The postprocessor rewrites imports against the existing reviewed vendor manifest; it refuses a new unresolved dependency. The checked-in `runtime/mvu_zod.js` is the upstream distribution with only the documented string/import substitutions; its corresponding TypeScript source is included separately.

The build used Node 24.18.1, webpack 5.111.0 and TypeScript 5.9.3. Webpack's build/version information can vary across machines; release integrity is determined by the checked-in SHA-256 manifest, not by an assertion of deterministic build metadata.

The host supplies Vue, jQuery, lodash, Zod and YAML APIs. Model-provider API addresses in SDKs are endpoints, not downloadable static assets. Two variable import helpers belong to Node-only SDK paths; browser execution was tested separately. No image assets are downloaded by the card runtime.

Japanese story variables are defined by the character card. The runtime's old settings spellings are accepted only at its input-normalization boundary to avoid corrupting shared Chinese settings; canonical writes use Japanese business keys and enums.
